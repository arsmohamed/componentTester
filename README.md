# Component Testing Interface

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for testing React components. The interface allows users to input component code, define props, generate mocking data, and execute tests on the provided component.

## Project Overview

The interface comprises several key components:

### 1. Text Editor Component

Users can paste their React component code in a text editor area. The provided code should be in JSX format. This component uses the 'react-codemirror2' library to facilitate code input.

### 2. Props Input Fields

Input fields allow users to define the necessary props for the component being tested. Users can specify prop names and corresponding values. This input helps in generating mock data for testing.

### 3. Mock Data Generator

Based on the defined props, a function generates mock data using the 'faker' library or similar. The generated mock data is utilized when rendering the user-provided component for testing.

### 4. Testing and Result Display

Upon initiating the test, the provided component is rendered dynamically using React's capabilities. The interface checks the behavior, rendering, and functionality of the component based on the defined props and mock data. It displays the test results, including pass/fail status and any encountered errors.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`

## Security Considerations

- **Unsafe Code Execution**: The current implementation uses 'eval' for evaluating user-provided code, which is highly unsafe and not recommended for production. Consider using secure sandboxing solutions for code evaluation.
- **Input Validation**: Implement thorough input validation to prevent code injections or malicious input from users.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to raise issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements to enhance the functionality, security, or usability of the component testing interface.
